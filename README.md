Profitability improves without outliers, with the average profit rising from 21.97 to 38.58, suggesting that strategic discounting can enhance financial outcomes.

The data reflects a diverse product price range, where higher discounts on premium items drive sales and improve the correlation between sales and profit (0.58).
